# SIGNUP PAGE
Sign-Up Form project for The Odin Project

# INFO
This is one of the advances projects from The Odin Project. As of now, this project is finished. If you want to try it out, please don't put any personal
information as the page will return the responses you put in the fields as part of the verification. You have to provide a Name, valid email and password.
There's no requirement for the password as of now, just for simplicity. I also added dark mode support, however, I still have to implement it by default
depending on the preferences of the user.

# LIVE PREVIEW

Check out the [live preview](https://kagunecode.github.io/signup-form/). Please, let me know if you have any problems with it. The background image might take a while to load, I'm not sure how to fix this yet since it's more of a GitHub thing.
